# Deep Learning Starter

## About

Deep Learning Starters is a collection of fast fundamental machine learning practice sets in Python.

It aims to help someone get started fast and gain a high-level understanding of the fundamental steps in the deep learning lifecycle early on.

After completion, someone will have built intuition over the deep learning lifecycle.
